export default (props) => <WorkLogLayout workLog={workLog} {...props} />

By integrating IPN data into their software systems, businesses can automate order processing workflows. For example,
they can automatically assign, group, filter, and categorize data turn them into leads and assign them into many bucket
lists, making that data available for export. For example, on [clickincomepro](https://data.clickincomepro.cc/) the client requested to create account offers by product
and streamline lead capture based on the frontend product ids.

There will be 2 main roles on the app the account offer manager and the account offer user. The account offer manager
will get permissions to manage settings like enable account offer lead duplicates, update the quota level etc. The offer
will only be able to preview leads and export them.
## App Details

Over the years, I have been relayed on [Jumpstart](https://jumpstartrails.com/), a starter template designed to accelerate
the development process of web applications. I adapted the starter data models for user and account/offers management
in this application. Furthermore, I developed custom data models such as incoming webhook, lead, dynamic queues, and sales phones.
